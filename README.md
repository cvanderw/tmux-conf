# tmux-conf

This project includes my own personal configuration files for tmux.

This configuration has been tested to work across Linux and macOS and has a theme/style
that is reasonably pleasant to read and use across a number of monitor sizes.
This is tested to work on Tmux version 3.1.

The main purpose of this project is to allow me to easily share an identical
configuration across all my devices (at home and work). If others find this useful then
that's great too.
